## How do I join rooms?
planning to add a new feature that makes you join random lobbies but you'll have to do this at the moment:

step 1: make sure your gamemode is selected  to "MODDED CASUAL" if not then set it to it with your VR headset.

step 2: generate a room with the "generate room" button.

step 3: use your freecam to move above the join trigger at stump(just like the added example)
